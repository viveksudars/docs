    />
  </Card>

  **Definition**: 
  Filter to data for touchpoints that occurred during a specified date range. 
  
  **How it works**:
  When selecting a date range, like 12/1 - 12/14, "Tactic Touch Date" will show the touches that occurred during that period for 
  each of the categories, channels or tactics you're viewing. If you are in Acquisition, for example, you'll see data
  for each marketing category (ex. Paid, Organic Search etc.) based on the interactions your visitors and users had with
  those categories between 12/1 and 12/14.

  **When to use this option:**
  This is the default option and is useful for understanding the overall influence of your marketing channels. Because it cuts to
  just the touchpoints that occured during the time range selected, it helps you understand what actually happened in terms of activity
  across any stage for the given timeframe. 
    
  **How to intepret the resulting data:**:
  - **Engagement columns (ex. Accounts Engaged)**: Engagement columns will show the number of visitors, contacts and accounts that engaged with one
  of the categories, channels or tactics listed.
  - **Pipeline stage columns (ex. Leads Created)**: Pipeline columns will show ****new**** conversions to that specific pipeline stage that were 
  occurred ****after**** that visitor touched one of the categories, channels or tactics listed. For example, the Leads Created column for the 'Paid' category
  will show new leads that converted to the lead stage ****after**** interacting with a Paid channel.
  - **Influence columns (ex. Contacts Influenced or Influenced Revenue)**: Influence columns will show influence for contacts, accounts, opportunities or closed deals that were influenced after a contact touched the corresponding category, channel or tactic. For example, if a contact interacted with a paid ad during the date range you've selected and then moved into the opportunity stage, they would be counted in opportunities influenced.

  the chosen stage in the timeframe you've selected. If you are in Acquisition and have selected Lead Create Date, for example, you'll see marketing
  activity for leads that entered the Lead stage in your pipeline between 12/1 and 12/14.

  **When to use this option:**
  This is option is for understanding how a cohort of contacts have been interacting with your marketing and what has been most effective at
  driving them down the funnel. You should use these date options when trying to understand the behavior of contacts that entered a specific stage 
  during the date range you selected. For example, if you want to understand how contacts that became an MQL during your selected time range interacted
  with your marketing, you would select 'MQL Date' as the cohort date option.
    
  **How to intepret the resulting data:**:
  - **Engagement columns (ex. Accounts Engaged)**: Engagement columns will show the number of visitors, contacts and accounts in the stage you selected
  that interacted with each marketing category or channel listed.
  - **Pipeline stage columns (ex. Leads Created)**: Pipeline columns will show ****new**** conversions to that specific pipeline stage that were 
  occurred ****after**** that visitor touched one of the categories, channels or tactics listed. For example, the Opportunities Created column for the 'Paid' category, when selected into MQL date, will show the contacts that entered the MQL stage during the time range you selected and subsequently converted to the opportunity stage ****after**** interacting with a Paid channel.
  - **Influence columns (ex. Contacts Influenced or Influenced Revenue)**: Influence columns will show influence for contacts, accounts, opportunities or closed deals that were influenced after a contact, in the stage you selected, touched the corresponding category, channel or tactic. For example, if you selected MQL date, the data will be cut to contacts that entered the MQL stage during the time range you selected. If one of those contacts interacted with a paid ad in that time range and then closed won it would be reflected in influenced revenue.
